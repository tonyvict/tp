## Introduction
Welcome to the ClassRosterPro User Guide!
Juggling student contacts, lesson schedules, and notes across different notebooks and apps?
**ClassRosterPro** is a powerful desktop application built for private tutors
to **centralize and manage all their student details.**

While it has a clean Graphical User Interface (GUI), it is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI).
If you can type fast, you can manage your student **roster—finding,
updating, and organizing** much faster than with a mouse.

## About This Guide
Welcome to the ClassRosterPro User Guide!
This guide is designed to help you, a private tutor, efficiently manage all your student information in one place.
* If you are a new user, we highly recommend starting with the "Quick Start"
  section to get set up and run your first command in just 5 minutes
* If you are an experienced user, jump directly to the "Features" section for a complete list of commands.
* Look out for Tips and Common Mistakes icons to help you use ClassRosterPro more effectively.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html). <br>
   **Windows users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationWindows.html). <br>
   **Linux users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationLinux.html).
2. Download the latest `ClassRosterPro.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your ClassRosterPro.

4. In the home folder, right click and select `Open in Terminal`

5. Use the `java -jar classrosterpro.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/UI.png)

6. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it.
For example, typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
7. Try adding your first student using the command:

   `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 t/Math t/Grade10`

   _This command adds a student named "John Doe" with his phone, email, address, and two tags indicating he's a Grade 10 Math student._

Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all students.

   * `open 1` : Expands the student's contact card for the first student in the current list.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd student shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all students.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/Grade10` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used zero or multiple times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as `t/friend` or `t/friend t/family`

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER` then `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span
multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Editing the data file

**ClassRosterPro** data is saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`.
Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: Caution:
If your changes to the data file make its format invalid, ClassRosterPro will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.
Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause **ClassRosterPro** to behave in unexpected ways
(e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range).
Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous ClassRosterPro home folder.

**Q**: Is there an undo command?<br>
**A**: Currently, ClassRosterPro does not support an undo function. Please use commands with care, especially delete and clear.

**Q**: What happens if I forget to include a compulsory field when adding a student?<br>
**A**: ClassRosterPro will show an error message explaining which field is missing and the correct format for the add command.

**Q**: Can I use the same attribute tags for multiple students?<br>
**A**: Yes! That's the main purpose of tags. You can use the filter command to find all students with a specific tag.

**Q**: Can I see my teaching schedule for the week?<br>
**A**: Currently, you need to check each student individually using the open command. Future versions may include a calendar view.

**Q**: Why can't I see all the details for a student?<br>
**A**: Student cards start in a collapsed state to save space. Use the open INDEX command to expand a student's card and view all their details.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
