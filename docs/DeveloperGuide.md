## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Help Command

#### What it does

Shows the in-app help window with a curated command summary so tutors can quickly recall syntax without leaving the application.

#### Execution walkthrough

When a user enters `help`, `LogicManager` instantiates `HelpCommand`. The command returns a `CommandResult` that sets the `showHelp` flag to `true`, instructing the UI to open (or refocus) the help window. The textual summary displayed comes from `HelpCommand.SHOWING_HELP_MESSAGE`.

#### Design considerations

- Keep help content in code to guarantee the window works even when offline.
- The window opens idempotently—the same command simply refocuses the existing help stage instead of spawning duplicates.
- The `CommandResult` flagging approach keeps UI behaviour configurable without introducing UI dependencies into the logic layer.

### Add Command

#### What it does

Creates a new student entry with core contact information and optional tags. This is the primary way tutors build the roster.

#### Execution walkthrough

`AddressBookParser` delegates `add` commands to `AddCommandParser`, which tokenises by CLI prefixes, validates each mandatory field, and constructs a `Person`. `AddCommand#execute(Model)` then checks for duplicates via `model.hasPerson`; if none are found, `model.addPerson` is called and a success message is returned.

#### Design considerations

- Input validation happens during parsing so users see errors before the model is mutated.
- Duplicate detection relies on `Person#isSamePerson`, ensuring identity rules stay centralised in the model.
- For a detailed diagrammatic breakdown, see the subsequent **Add Student Command** section.

### List Command

#### What it does

Resets the student list back to the full roster after filters, searches, or attribute-based queries.

#### Execution walkthrough

`ListCommand#execute(Model)` invokes `model.updateFilteredPersonList(Model.PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS)`, restoring the observable list that backs the UI. The command then returns a simple confirmation message; no data is mutated.

#### Design considerations

- The command runs in O(n) because the filtered list wraps the master list—no deep copies are made.
- Display logic stays in the UI; `ListCommand` only manipulates the predicate to maintain separation of concerns.
- Returning an explicit acknowledgement helps the user confirm that the reset completed.

### Open Command

#### What it does

Expands a student's card in the UI so tutors can inspect lessons, grades, tags, and other extended details.

#### Execution walkthrough

`OpenCommand` resolves the target index against the current filtered list. It ensures the index is valid and that the card is not already expanded, then toggles the `Person`'s `expandedProperty` to `true`. The bound UI updates automatically and the command returns a confirmation message.

#### Design considerations

- Expansion state lives on the `Person` object, keeping UI behaviour consistent even when the list is resorted or filtered.
- Guard clauses prevent redundant state flips and provide clear error messages when the card is already open.
- Operations stay synchronous; no additional events or asynchronous callbacks are required.

### Close Command

#### What it does

Collapses an expanded student card to restore the compact list view.

#### Execution walkthrough

Similar to `OpenCommand`, `CloseCommand` validates the index, checks that the card is currently open, and flips the `expandedProperty` to `false`. A confirmation message indicates success; otherwise a descriptive error is thrown.

#### Design considerations

- Mirroring the open logic keeps the commands complementary and predictable.
- Using the same `expandedProperty` ensures toggling works regardless of how the card was opened (command or future UI triggers).
- Input validation reuses `Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_PERSON_DISPLAYED_INDEX`, maintaining a consistent error vocabulary across commands.

### Clear Command

#### What it does

Wipes the entire roster, removing every stored student and resetting the dataset to a blank state.

#### Execution walkthrough

`ClearCommand#execute(Model)` constructs a new empty `AddressBook` instance and passes it to `model.setAddressBook(...)`. Because the model exposes an observable list, the UI immediately reflects the cleared roster. A confirmation message is returned to the user.

#### Design considerations

- The operation is destructive; users should be advised to back up data before running it. Undo is not available.
- Creating a fresh `AddressBook` is simpler than iterating through students, keeping the command O(1) relative to roster size.
- By reusing the setter in `Model`, storage and persistence layers automatically pick up the new state on the next save cycle.

### Exit Command

#### What it does

Terminates the application gracefully after acknowledging the user's request.

#### Execution walkthrough

`ExitCommand` returns a `CommandResult` with the `exit` flag set to `true`. `LogicManager` forwards this to the UI, which listens for the flag and triggers application shutdown while allowing final persistence tasks (e.g., saving preferences) to complete.

#### Design considerations

- The command never throws; exiting is always considered successful.
- Using flags in `CommandResult` keeps lifecycle management in the UI layer, avoiding logic-to-UI coupling.
- Any cleanup (saving logs, closing windows) can be centralised in the UI's response to the flag rather than scattered across commands.

### Add Student Command

#### What it does

Registers a new student in the roster. The created `Person` initially has empty remark, grade, and lesson lists; tags may be provided to group students immediately.

#### Parameters

`add n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]...`

- `n/` — required. Full student name; validated by `Name#isValidName`.
- `p/` — required. Contact number; must satisfy `Phone#isValidPhone`.
- `e/` — required. Email address; checked by `Email#isValidEmail`.
- `a/` — required. Free-form postal address.
- `t/` — optional, repeatable. Adds tags; each value must satisfy `Tag#isValidTagName`.

The command rejects missing mandatory prefixes, duplicate occurrences of the same mandatory prefix, and malformed values.

#### Overview

The `add` command follows the standard command pattern of *parse → construct command → execute on the model*.

#### High-level flow

![Add command activity](images/AddCommandActivityDiagram.png)

The activity diagram captures the user journey: the tutor submits the command, the system validates the input, and either reports a duplicate or persists the new student before confirming success.

#### Parsing pipeline

![Add command parser sequence](images/AddCommandParserSequence.png)

The sequence diagram shows how control moves from `LogicManager` to `AddressBookParser` and finally to `AddCommandParser`. The parser:

1. Tokenises the raw arguments by prefixes (`n/`, `p/`, `e/`, `a/`, `t/`).
2. Ensures the preamble is empty and every mandatory prefix appears exactly once.
3. Delegates to `ParserUtil` to construct domain objects (`Name`, `Phone`, `Email`, `Address`, `Tag`).
4. Builds a `Person` with default `Remark`, `LessonList`, and `GradeList`, and returns a fully initialised `AddCommand`.

Key classes: `AddCommandParser`, `ParserUtil`, `Person`.

#### Execution behaviour

![Add command execution sequence](images/AddCommandExecuteSequence.png)

The sequence diagram documents the runtime checks when `AddCommand#execute(Model)` is invoked. The command:

1. Calls `model.hasPerson(toAdd)` to guard against duplicates.
2. Throws `CommandException` with `MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_PERSON` if a match exists.
3. Otherwise adds the student via `model.addPerson(toAdd)` and formats the success message through `Messages.format`.

Key classes: `AddCommand`, `Model`, `Messages`.

#### Validation and error handling

- Missing or repeated mandatory prefixes trigger `ParseException` with usage guidance.
- Invalid value formats (e.g., phone, email) are rejected by the respective domain constructors inside `ParserUtil`.
- Duplicate students—based on the `Person#isSamePerson` identity definition—are blocked during execution.

### Edit Student Command

#### What it does

Updates selected fields of an existing student without replacing the whole entry. Fields omitted from the command remain unchanged.

#### Parameters

`edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]... [attr/KEY=VALUE]...`

- `INDEX` — required, 1-based. Identifies the student in the current filtered list.
- `n/`, `p/`, `e/`, `a/` — optional single-occurrence fields; if present, must pass the same validators as `add`.
- `t/` — optional, repeatable; replaces the tag set when provided. Supplying a lone `t/` clears all tags.
- `attr/` — optional, repeatable; replaces the attribute set. Supplying `attr/` with an empty value clears attributes.

At least one field beyond the index must be provided; otherwise the command rejects the input.

#### Overview

The edit command follows the same *parse → command → execute* pattern as other logic features.

#### High-level flow

![Edit command activity](images/EditCommandActivityDiagram.png)

The activity diagram illustrates the conditional checks: field presence, index validation, duplicate detection, and final update.

#### Parsing pipeline

![Edit command parser sequence](images/EditCommandParserSequence.png)

The sequence diagram shows how `AddressBookParser` delegates to `EditCommandParser`. The parser:

1. Tokenises optional fields and isolates the index preamble.
2. Verifies that at least one editable field was supplied.
3. Parses the index and checks for duplicate single-use prefixes.
4. Builds an `EditPersonDescriptor`, parsing tags and attributes through `ParserUtil`.
5. Ensures the descriptor contains changes before instantiating `EditCommand`.

Key classes: `EditCommandParser`, `EditPersonDescriptor`, `ParserUtil`.

#### Execution behaviour

![Edit command execution sequence](images/EditCommandExecuteSequence.png)

The sequence diagram  captures the runtime flow:

1. Fetch the targeted student from the filtered list and guard against invalid indices.
2. Produce an edited `Person` by merging descriptor values with the original.
3. If the identity changes and clashes with another student, throw `MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_PERSON`.
4. Otherwise replace the entry, refresh the list, and return a success message.

Key classes: `EditCommand`, `Model`, `Messages`.

#### Validation and error handling

- Missing optional fields trigger `MESSAGE_NOT_EDITED`.
- Invalid indices reuse the shared index error message.
- Identity conflicts are blocked before the model is mutated.

### Delete Student Command

#### What it does

Removes a student from the roster using their displayed index.

#### Parameters

`delete INDEX`

- `INDEX` — required, 1-based. Must reference an entry in the current filtered list.

#### Overview

Deletion is the simplest command flow: parse the index, resolve it against the filtered list, and delete the matching person.

#### High-level flow

![Delete command activity](images/DeleteCommandActivityDiagram.png)

The activity diagram highlights the single decision point—whether the supplied index is valid.

#### Parsing pipeline

![Delete command parser sequence](images/DeleteCommandParserSequence.png)

The sequence diagram  shows the brief parser interaction: `requireSingleIndex`, `parseIndex`, then creation of a `DeleteCommand`.

Key classes: `DeleteCommandParser`, `ParserUtil`.

#### Execution behaviour

![Delete command execution sequence](images/DeleteCommandExecuteSequence.png)

The sequence diagram  depicts the execution: retrieve the filtered list, guard against invalid indices, remove the student through `model.deletePerson`, and format a confirmation message with `Messages.format`. Key classes: `DeleteCommand`, `Model`, `Messages`.

#### Validation and error handling

- Invalid indices throw `MESSAGE_INVALID_PERSON_DISPLAYED_INDEX`.
- Because the command is irreversible, consider pairing it with undo when available.

### Mark Student Attendance Command

#### What it does

Marks a student's attendance for a specific lesson as 'present'. This helps tutors keep an accurate record of class attendance, which is essential for tracking student records and for billing purposes.

#### Parameters

`mark INDEX lesson/LESSON_INDEX`

-   `INDEX` — required, 1-based. Identifies the student in the current filtered list.
-   `LESSON_INDEX` — required, 1-based. Identifies the lesson in the student's lesson list, which is visible when the student's card is expanded.

#### Overview

The `mark` command follows the standard command pattern of *parse → construct command → execute on the model*. It is designed to be a quick and straightforward way to update a single lesson's attendance.

#### High-level flow

!Mark command activity

The activity diagram shows the user's journey: the tutor provides the student and lesson indices, the system validates them, checks if the lesson is already marked, and then updates the attendance status before confirming success.

#### Parsing pipeline

!Mark command parser sequence

The sequence diagram shows how `AddressBookParser` delegates to `MarkCommandParser`. The parser:

1.  Tokenises the arguments to find the person `INDEX` and the `lesson/LESSON_INDEX`.
2.  Uses `ParserUtil` to parse both indices into `Index` objects.
3.  Ensures both indices are present and valid.
4.  Instantiates and returns a fully initialised `MarkCommand`.

Key classes: `MarkCommandParser`, `ParserUtil`.

#### Execution behaviour

!Mark command execution sequence

The sequence diagram documents the runtime checks when `MarkCommand#execute(Model)` is invoked. The command:

1.  Retrieves the target `Person` from the filtered list using the person index.
2.  Retrieves the target `Lesson` from the person's `LessonList` using the lesson index.
3.  Checks if the lesson is already marked as present. If so, it throws a `CommandException` with `MESSAGE_LESSON_ALREADY_MARKED`.
4.  Creates a new `Lesson` object with the same details but with its attendance status set to `true`.
5.  Creates a new `Person` object with the updated `LessonList`.
6.  Calls `model.setPerson(...)` to replace the old person object with the new one, and returns a success message.

Key classes: `MarkCommand`, `Model`, `Person`, `Lesson`, `LessonList`.

#### Validation and error handling

-   Invalid or missing student `INDEX` throws `MESSAGE_INVALID_PERSON_DISPLAYED_INDEX`.
-   Invalid or missing `LESSON_INDEX` throws `MESSAGE_INVALID_LESSON_DISPLAYED_INDEX`.
-   Attempting to mark a lesson that is already marked as present throws `MESSAGE_LESSON_ALREADY_MARKED`.

#### Design Considerations

-   **Immutability**: The command creates new `Lesson` and `Person` objects instead of mutating existing ones. This aligns with the functional programming paradigm and makes state management more predictable.
-   **Idempotency Check**: The check for whether a lesson is already marked prevents redundant operations and provides clear feedback to the user, avoiding confusion.
-   **User Experience**: The command requires two separate indices, which is clear but requires the user to first identify the student and then the specific lesson. This is a trade-off for precision.
-   **Flexibility**: The command intentionally allows marking lessons in the past, present, or future. This gives tutors the flexibility to catch up on old attendance records or pre-mark attendance for a known upcoming attendance.

### Unmark Student Attendance Command

#### What it does

Reverts a student's attendance for a specific lesson to 'not present'. This is useful for correcting mistakes made during attendance-taking.

#### Parameters

`unmark INDEX lesson/LESSON_INDEX`

-   `INDEX` — required, 1-based. Identifies the student in the current filtered list.
-   `LESSON_INDEX` — required, 1-based. Identifies the lesson in the student's lesson list.

#### Overview

The `unmark` command is the direct counterpart to the `mark` command and follows the same *parse → command → execute* pattern. Its primary function is to reverse an attendance mark.

#### High-level flow

!Unmark command activity

The activity diagram illustrates the flow for unmarking a lesson, which mirrors the `mark` command's logic: validate indices, check the current state, update the lesson, and confirm the change.

#### Parsing pipeline

!Unmark command parser sequence

The sequence diagram shows `AddressBookParser` delegating to `UnmarkCommandParser`. The parser:

1.  Parses the person `INDEX` from the preamble.
2.  Parses the `lesson/LESSON_INDEX` from the prefixed arguments.
3.  Uses `ParserUtil` to validate and create `Index` objects for both.
4.  Constructs and returns an `UnmarkCommand` with the parsed indices.

Key classes: `UnmarkCommandParser`, `ParserUtil`.

#### Execution behaviour

!Unmark command execution sequence

The sequence diagram captures the runtime flow of `UnmarkCommand#execute(Model)`. The command:

1.  Retrieves the target `Person` and `Lesson` using the provided indices.
2.  Guards against invalid indices by throwing a `CommandException` if either is out of bounds.
3.  Checks if the lesson is already marked as 'not present'. If so, it throws a `CommandException` with `MESSAGE_LESSON_ALREADY_UNMARKED`.
4.  Creates a new `Lesson` with its attendance status set to `false`.
5.  Creates a new `Person` with the updated `LessonList`.
6.  Updates the model via `model.setPerson(...)` and returns a success message confirming the change.

Key classes: `UnmarkCommand`, `Model`, `Person`, `Lesson`, `LessonList`.

#### Validation and error handling

-   Invalid student `INDEX` throws `MESSAGE_INVALID_PERSON_DISPLAYED_INDEX`.
-   Invalid `LESSON_INDEX` throws `MESSAGE_INVALID_LESSON_DISPLAYED_INDEX`.
-   Attempting to unmark a lesson that is already 'not present' throws `MESSAGE_LESSON_ALREADY_UNMARKED`.

#### Design Considerations

-   **Symmetry with `mark`**: The command's structure, validation, and execution flow are intentionally symmetric with `MarkCommand` to ensure a consistent and predictable developer and user experience.
-   **Error-Correction Focus**: This command serves as a simple and direct way to correct errors, which is a critical usability feature for data entry applications.
-   **State-Awareness**: By checking if the lesson is already unmarked, the command avoids unnecessary model updates and provides precise feedback, preventing user confusion about the state of the data.
-   **Flexibility**: Mirroring the `mark` command, `unmark` also works on past, present, and future lessons. This is crucial for correcting historical attendance errors or adjusting plans for future lessons.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

## **1. Product Scope (Target User & Value Proposition)**

### **Target User Profile**

Private tutors who manage many students without the infrastructure of a tuition agency and need a fast, keyboard-driven desktop tool to keep contacts, lessons, attendance, grades, and notes organized.

### **Value Proposition**

ClassRosterPro reduces tutors' admin load by consolidating contacts, tagging/filtering, lesson scheduling, attendance tracking, grade recording, and quick search into one command-first desktop app—so time goes to teaching, not record-keeping.

## **7. Architecture Overview**

ClassRosterPro follows a layered architecture adapted from AddressBook-Level3, ensuring high cohesion and low coupling across modules.  
Each major layer has a distinct responsibility:
- **UI**: Handles user interactions through JavaFX components and FXML layouts (e.g., `MainWindow`, `QuickSearchBox`).
- **Logic**: Parses user commands and executes them, returning `CommandResult` objects to the UI.
- **Model**: Manages in-memory data such as `Person`, `Lesson`, `Grade`, and `Tag`.
- **Storage**: Reads and writes persistent data to local JSON files.
- **Commons**: Contains shared utilities such as `Messages`, `LogsCenter`, and custom exceptions.

This modular structure supports easy feature addition (e.g., new commands) with minimal changes to existing code.

---

## **Appendix: Instructions for Manual Testing**

This section provides guidance to manually verify the new or modified features of ClassRosterPro. Each subsection gives a test path and copy‑pasteable inputs. Refer to the User Guide for full syntax. Ensure sample data in `data/addressbook.json` is loaded before testing.

### 1. Search

**Command name**: `search`

**Purpose**: Instantly locate students by typing into the search box.

**Steps to test**:
1. Launch the app and ensure several students are listed.

**Expected**: The list updates instantly to show only contacts whose name, phone, or email contains "alex".

### 2. Tag and Filter

**Command name**: `addattr` and `filter`

**Purpose**: Add attributes to students and filter the student list based on them.

**Steps to test**:
1. Tag a student with attributes:
   - `addattr 1 attr/subject=Math attr/age=16`
2. Verify attributes appear under the student's details.
3. Filter students by multiple attributes:
   - `filter attr/subject=Math attr/age=16`

**Expected**: Only students with both `subject=Math` and `age=16` are displayed.

### 3. Schedule and Unschedule Lessons

**Command name**: `schedule` and `unschedule`

**Purpose**: Create and remove scheduled lessons for a student.

**Steps to test**:
1. Schedule a lesson for the first student:
   - `schedule 1 start/14:00 end/15:00 date/2025-11-01 sub/Science`
2. Remove the lesson:
   -`unschedule 1 lesson/1`.

**Expected**: A lesson entry appears after scheduling command in the expanded student card and is removed after unschedule command.

### 4. Attendance Tracking

**Command name**: `mark` and `unmark`

**Purpose**: Mark and unmark lesson attendance.

**Steps to test**:
1. Ensure a student has a scheduled lesson (see previous test). 
2. Mark attendance:
   - `mark 1 lesson/1`
3. Unmark attendance:
    - `unmark 1 lesson/1`

**Expected**: The lesson is marked as "Present" after mark command and marked as "Not Present" after unmark command.

### 5. Grade Recording

**Command name**: `grade`

**Purpose**: Record and update grades for various subjects and assessments.

**Steps to test**:
1. Add grades to a student:
   - `grade 1 sub/MATH/WA1/85 sub/SCIENCE/Quiz1/92`

**Expected**: The grades appear under the student's card.

**Steps to test**:
2. Add another grade for the same subject/assessment to test overwrite behavior:
   - `grade 1 sub/MATH/WA1/90`

**Expected**: The score for MATH/WA1 updates to 90.

### 6. Open and Close Student Cards

**Command name**: `open` and `close`

**Purpose**: Expand or collapse individual student cards to view or hide details.

**Steps to test**:
1. Enter `open 1`

**Expected**: The first student's card expands to show all details (lessons, grades, tags) after open command and collapses back to its summary view after close command.

### 7. Delete Attributes

**Command name**: `delattr`

**Purpose**: Remove specific attributes from a student.

**Steps to test**:
1. Add attributes first (if not present):
   - `addattr 1 attr/subject=Math attr/level=Sec3`
2. Delete an attribute:
   - `delattr 1 attr/level`

**Expected**: Only the `level` attribute is removed; `subject=Math` remains.
